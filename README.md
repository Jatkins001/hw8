we start by setting up the lm model to take a look at how our independent variables, Region, head of household race and age 
may impact the age difference between tradtional couples(male+female). we then run an anova test which tells us said impact. find 
find that the Pvalues are very small which indicates significant correlation. finally, we graph the lm model to visualize 
better understand it. After analyzing the grapgh we realize some interesting patterns, namely, probability dips as age grows
indicating on average, the probability of a 10+yr couple decreases overal with age . we also see that the pacific division and mountain 
division have higher probability of the age difference being +10yrs.
